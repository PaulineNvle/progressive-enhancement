                <h2>The story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
                        They said,
                        <blockquote>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote>
                        The farmer said,
                        <blockquote> <em><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></em></blockquote>
                        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                        <blockquote>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</blockquote> 
                        The farmer again said,
                        <blockquote><em><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></em></blockquote> 
                        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
                        <blockquote>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</blockquote>
                        and the farmer responded,
                        <blockquote><em><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></em></blockquote>
                        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
                        <blockquote>“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote>
                        Again, he said,
                        <blockquote><em><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></em></blockquote>
                        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
